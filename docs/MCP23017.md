# RoxMCP23017 and RoxMCP23018

This is a simple library to read and write to the MCP23017 and/or MCP23018

You can control them the same way you would a built-in pin using pinMode(), digitalRead() and digitalWrite()

See the examples for code information.

GPIO on MCP23017 goes like this:
- GPA0 = pin 0
- GPA1 = pin 1
- GPA2 = pin 2
- GPA3 = pin 3
- GPA4 = pin 4
- GPA5 = pin 5
- GPA6 = pin 6
- GPA7 = pin 7
- GPB0 = pin 8
- GPB1 = pin 9
- GPB2 = pin 10
- GPB3 = pin 11
- GPB4 = pin 12
- GPB5 = pin 13
- GPB6 = pin 14
- GPB7 = pin 15
